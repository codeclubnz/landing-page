# Our Mission

To give every **kiwi kid** the chance to learn to code. We want to help New Zealand children to **combine their imaginations** with an understanding of programming, **empowering our next generation** to take their incredible inventions to the world.

Code Club helps **volunteers and schools** find each other and creates projects for volunteers to teach at club sessions.
