# Our Journey

It all started with a presentation at a single school where we were overwhelmed by the response. Over **15 percent** of the students at that first school signed up to learn to code outside of school hours! We now have growing, thriving club communities in the major centers and are now focusing on support and training for volunteers and teachers as their clubs grow.
