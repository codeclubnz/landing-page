# The Battle for NZ Inc.

New Zealand is currently short of an estimated **10,000** skilled IT professionals and that number is projected to balloon over the coming decade.

As an industry, we face becoming hamstrung by this talent shortage. Our potential as a **leading hi-tech nation** could be lost because we failed to foster the next generation of IT professionals

Since our launch in October 2014 we helped over **100 Code Clubs** open across the country. With your financial help, we want to grow this number of clubs to **200+** by the finish of 2015. This would mean around **3000 kiwi kids learning to code for free every week**.
